 This project is using API for pull information together based on user input information. 

 The project shows that it is possible to use API to get information and sort it out based on our parameters.

 Getting started on this project you would need a basic understanding of how callbacks work and how to get information puarsed into specific ways we asked for it.

 There are a lot of bot projects that are coded on the internet or do basic callback searches and that would be the best place to start.

 The maintaining of this project wil be done by those that are manipulating the code that they find.
